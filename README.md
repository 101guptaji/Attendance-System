# Attendance-System
“Attendance System” is webapp developed for maintaining the attendance of the student on the daily basis in the collage. Here the faculties, who are handling the courses, will be responsible to mark the attendance of the students. Each faculty will be given with a separate username and password based on the course they handle. An accurate report based on the student attendance is generated here. This system will also help in evaluating attendance of a student. Students can also see their attendance in registered course.
